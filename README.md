This is StandardizeROI, a matlab script that helps to standarized the ROI extraction for e-field calculation. There are cases when coordinates obtained from the literature fall outside the gray matter layer. This simple scripts takes as an input a coordinate in either MNI or native subject space and return the closest gray matter surface from the coordinate of interest using the euclidian distance formula. This methodological approach allows to obtain a similar amount of mesh elements (tetahedra or nodes) between and within subjects.
